# Discord Snipe bot 

Basic 2 commands that spits out the most recently deleted message using discord.py 2.0.0a

<h1> 🤨 What is the purpose? </h1>

The main purpose of this bot is to spit out a silly message someone might've sent. It's similar to when someone makes a typo and they get teased. Just keep in mind that getting deleted messages may be fun with friends or people you feel comfortable around but privacy is also important.

<h2> Commands </h2>

`snipe` <br>

`snipeedit`

<h2> Need Help? (Support Server) </h2>

If you need help setting this up, you can ask on the support server
